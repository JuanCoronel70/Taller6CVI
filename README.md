# How to Install

This is an OpenGL-based project that uses **GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library)** to manage OpenGL functions that may not be available due to versioning. The project also utilizes **GLFW (Graphics Library Framework)** to handle window creation, user input, events, and OpenGL contexts.

1. Download the GLEW binaries from the official [website](https://glew.sourceforge.net/).
2. Download the pre-compiled 32-bit binaries for Windows (or the appropriate version for your OS) from the official [GLFW website](https://www.glfw.org/download.html).
3. Extract the zip files.
4. Install Visual Studio with the C++ development tools (if you haven't done this already).
5. Clone this repository into Visual Studio.
